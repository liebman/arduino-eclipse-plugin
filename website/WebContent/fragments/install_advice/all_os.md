All os'es
==
**Do not use spaces in your paths.**
Not in your install path.
Not in your workspace path.
This counts for all os's and is a make limitation (make is the tool used to build your project).

**If you get strange startup fails: check your java version**  
run following in a command prompt   
java -showversion  
It should give you 1.8 or higher.  
The windows product has a jre (java runtime engine) included in the zip. So windows users should be fine.
