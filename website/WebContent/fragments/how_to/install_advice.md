Product Versus plugin
====
The plugin and the product are the same thing but they are packaged differently.
When you install the product you install the plugin and eclipse and other things that the arduino eclipse plugin development team thinks is interesting to have.
The plugin needs to be added to a eclipse installation that has CDT installed.

reasons to use the product
==
**Advised for starters**.
You don't know what you are doing.
You do not have eclipse on you system.
This is your first contact with Sloeber.
Easy install.
Fasted way to get started.

reasons to use the plugin
==
**Experts only **
You know about Sloeber, Eclipse, plugins and update sites.
It is easier for you to start from another eclipse product and add Sloeber than the other way around.
For instance because you already have that product (with extensions) on your system.

Which version
===
The latest stable product  
Unless advised differently (by a more advanced Sloeber user than you): Only go for the nightly if you feel comfortable with Sloeber and eclipse.

Java
===

V4 needs java 8

32 or 64 bit
===
Eclipse is stopping 32 bit support so if you use a 64 bit system use the 64 bit version. Note you need the java 64(/32) bit version when running 64(/32) bit Sloeber.  
On linux V4.3 is reported to fail.
