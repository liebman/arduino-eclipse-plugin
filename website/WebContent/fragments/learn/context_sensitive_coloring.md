Context sensitive coloring 
========
Sloeber supports quite a bit of context sensitive coloring. as you can see on this image  
![Arduino IDE look](http://eclipse.baeyens.it/img/arduinoo-ide-style.png "arduino IDE")  

However there is far more support in Sloeber (that is : in CDT)
![Eclipse CDT look](http://eclipse.baeyens.it/img/sloeber-out-of-the-box-style.png "eclipse CDT look")  

and far more flexibility to change it to your needs. Below is Sloeber with arduino IDE look alike Context sensitive. After fiddling a bit in the preferences.

Well.... I didn't go as far as making the defines look as bad as in the Arduino IDE.  
And to be fair. This is a simple example. More complex stuff may not look so alike. But hey it does show it is far more powerfull than the possibilities offered by the arduino IDE.
