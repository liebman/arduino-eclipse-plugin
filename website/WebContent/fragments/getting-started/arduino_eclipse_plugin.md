Sloeber
======================
The Sloeber is the part that makes the life of a Arduino developer easier in Eclipse CDT. Simply put: eclipse/CDT knows how to build a C/C++ project with all ins and outs; the Sloeber tells it the ins and outs needed for Arduino development.

The plugin started as a plugin that needs to be installed on a Eclipse environment that holds the Eclipse CDT plugin. Later we added a bundle of the plugin with CDT and Eclipse as a product so you can download 1 file and get started.

Apart from the CDT integration part the plugin also delivers
A menu item with common Arduino functionality

  * verify
  * upload sketch

  * add a library
  * ...

A toolbar with the same buttons you find in Arduino IDE

A multi channel serial monitor.

A 6 channel scope (works on the first serial monitor connection only.)

A boards manager to add and remove boards.

A library manager to add and remove libraries.
