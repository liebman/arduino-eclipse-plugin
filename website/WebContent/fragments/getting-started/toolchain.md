Toolchain
====
The toolchain is the compiler linker and archiver that make you C/C++ code a hex file.  
When you install a platform in the boards manage this will also install the needed tools for the tool chain.  
This way Sloeber knows where the tools are installed and can tell CDT to use these tools.
