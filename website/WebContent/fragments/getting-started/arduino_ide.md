Arduino IDE
============
From the Sloeber perspective there are 3 Arduino (IDE) versions.

V1 of sloeber uses the pre 1.5.x Arduino IDE.
V2 of sloeber uses Arduino IDE 1.5.x up to 1.6.x (with many gaps)
V3 and later of sloeber uses the Arduino formatted json files. As such Sloeber does not need a Arduino IDE installed.
However we advice to have the arduino IDE installed just in case there are issues so you can try wether it works in Arduino IDE.
