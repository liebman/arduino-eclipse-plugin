Avrdude
=======

Well, not really...

Avrdude is a tool used to upload your sketch onto an avr based board. It is delivered as part of the Arduino IDE and probably will remain a part of the Arduino IDE.

However it should be better to name this section "uploaders" as Sloeber also supports bosac (Teensy) and other upload protocols (like for uploading Yun over the network) or ESP8266.

But in Arduino world Avrdude is the best know uploader.
